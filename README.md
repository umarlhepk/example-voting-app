# Example Voting App Deployment with CI/CD on Azure

## Project Overview

I successfully deployed the Example Voting App on Azure, utilizing Azure DevOps for Continuous Integration (CI) and ArgoCD for Continuous Deployment (CD). This project demonstrates my proficiency in managing end-to-end CI/CD pipelines and deploying applications on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Key Highlights

- **Continuous Integration with Azure DevOps:**
  - Set up CI pipelines using Azure DevOps Repos to automate the application's building and testing.
  - Streamlined code changes and updates through version control integrated within Azure DevOps.

- **Continuous Deployment with GitOps using ArgoCD:**
  - Implemented ArgoCD to manage the application deployment on AKS.
  - Utilized shell scripts to enhance deployment automation and streamline processes.

- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Configuration:**
  - Created and configured an AKS cluster on Azure.
  - Set up Virtual Machine Scale Sets as node pools in AKS for efficient resource management.
  - Conducted hands-on sessions to demonstrate the deployment and scaling of applications on AKS.

- **End-to-End CI/CD Demonstration:**
  - Provided a comprehensive demonstration of the CI/CD pipeline from code commit to deployment.
  - Highlighted the integration of CI and CD tools to ensure a seamless and automated deployment process.
